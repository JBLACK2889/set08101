		<h3>Why horror movies?</h3>
		
		<p>
		<br>I have always had a fascination with horror movies, and the creative visions and cultural impact these movies have on the world. <br> 
		They provide a great source of entertainment, and can vary from campy, comical, or gritty, realistic and sometimes downright bizarre. 
		This quiz will cover all of the above, and will test your knowledge on these movies and their history.
